# Password Breaker
 A simple multithreaded password cracking script. This program was made for the purpose of demonstrating bruteforce attacks.
 The program works on multiple threads using multiple character sets to more effectively find passwords. One character set utilises commonly used words, and by expanding this 'dictionary', the program can be made more effective at finding passphrases constructed from words. Profanity is contained in the common words data set as these words are found surpisingly often in passwords ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:10,000_most_common_passwords), 2024).
# Use
 Download the program and run the breaker.js using Node-JS, follow instructions, then wait.
